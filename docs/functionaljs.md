### `First-Class Functions`

- First class functions are functions that are treated like an object (or are assignable to a variable). Higher order functions are functions that take at least one first class function as a parameter. Values in a language that are handled uniformly throughout are called "first class"

### `Immutability`

- In functional programming, variables are not able to be changed. `const` is used much more often. We don't _assign_, we _define_.

- Programs often start off with an immutable set of data as a single source of truth, and then we use functions to combine this data piece by piece and transform it into useful information.

### `Separating Functions and Data`

- Pieces of data are not considered objects in fuctional programming. Data must be passed as arguments to Functions.

### `Declarative vs Imperative Programming`

Fuctional programming is a **Declarative** style of programming, while object oriented and procedural programming are **Imperative**. Declaritave programming focuses more on 'what things are', as opposed to 'how to get them'.

- Imperative describes how something is made.
- Declarative describes what something is.
